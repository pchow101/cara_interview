Take-home code questions:

Pick one of the required languages: C#, Python, Javascript

Pick one of the following questions, upload code to github/gitlab and email a link to justin.s.lindsey@nasa.gov
Create tests as necessary to validate the code. Timebox to 3 hours and stop past that point. 


1. Create a task scheduler that schedules programs to run at a user configurable time.

Acceptance Criteria:
    * Tasks can be scheduled or ran immiediately
    * Tasks can be canceled/killed before they have completed execution
    * Tasks should only execute one instance of the program while it's running
    * User configurable time can be a time interval (ie. every 5 minutes), or a specific time (03/16/2021 at 4:00PM EST)
    * An example task can be a simple program that simulates work or execution by waiting
    * User config should also include the location of the program to run at the scheduled time
    * Multiple different configured tasks should be able to run simultanouesly
    * User config is a serialized JSON config read from a file, status of running tasks can be output to console
    * Task scheduler should accept the following commands:
        start "TaskName" - starts task based on config, which is either immiediately or scheduled
        stop "TaskName" - stops task immiediately
    * Use the location that corresponds to your system, ie. Can limit to either Windows (.exe), Linux (anything with execute bit) or Mac

Example Config:
config.json
{
	"task_config": [{
			"task_name": "Scheduled Task",
			"task_location": "C:\\Users\\myuser\\scheduled_task.exe",
			"task_interval": 5000,
			"task_scheduled_time": "03/16/2020 04:00:00 EST",
			"task_scheduled": "true"
		},
		{
			"task_name": "Important Task",
			"task_location": "C:\\Users\\myuser\\important_task.exe",
			"task_interval": 0,
			"task_scheduled_time": "",
			"task_scheduled": "false"
		}
	]
}

2. Create a key/value parallel file parser

Acceptance Criteria:
    * Keys and values are stored in a *.kv file with a separator character '=' and a newline separator '\n' or '\r\n'
    * Create a program to write many (10,000+) example .kv files with any key/value data inside a directory
    * Find all files in a directory with the extension .kv
    * Parallel read the files, and parse all of the key/values pairs into a shared dictionary
    * If there are key name collisions, then append values to a list
    * Print the shared dictionary to console after reading all of the files
    * Treat the key names as strict (so 'node' and 'Node' are different)
    * Optimize for one or more of the following (Looking for explanation of choice/tradeoffs):
        - memory usage
        - # of files parsed concurrently
        - CPU utilization    

Example File Format: test.kv
Key=Value
Node=1
Node         =  2
OBJECT_ID=145678
OBJECT_ID              =         123654

3. Create a CRUD frontend with framework of choice (React/Angular/Vue/etc)

Acceptance Criteria:
    * Given a data model described in JSON, generate inputs to change the JSON
    * JSON is input into a textbox
    * Booleans are represented by checkboxes
    * Integers/Text are represented by textboxes of sufficient length
    * Lists are represented by a group of appropriate inputs
    * Objects are represented by subforms containing inputs for each property
    * Basic validation to prevent empty or null values, or bad input JSON
    * Utilize material/bootstrap or equivalent UI framework to enhance look and feel of components
    * Submit button can just generate the changed JSON, and show it below (doesn't need to submit to a server)

Example JSON (Schema can be created at https://jsonschema.net/home)
{
    "checked": false,
    "dimensions": {
        "width": 5,
        "height": 10
    },
    "id": 1,
    "name": "A green door",
    "price": 12.5,
    "tags": [
        "home",
        "green"
    ]
}
